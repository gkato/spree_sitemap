Configuration Options
---------------------

Check out the [README][1] for the [sitemap_generator][1].

Installation
------------

1) add the gem to your `Gemfile`:
```ruby
gem 'spree_sitemap', github: 'gkato/spree_sitemap', branch: 'master'
```

2) run bundler:

`bundle install`

3) run the installer, it will create a `config/sitemap.rb` file with some sane defaults

`rails g spree_sitemap:install`

4) add sitemap to your `.gitignore`

`echo "public/sitemap*" >> .gitignore`

5) setup a daily cron job to regenrate your sitemap via the `rake sitemap:refresh` task. If you use the Whenever gem, add this to your `config/schedule.rb`
```ruby
every 1.day, at: '5:00 am' do
  rake '-s sitemap:refresh'
end
```

6) make sure crawlers can find the sitemap, by adding the following line to your `public/robots.txt` with your correct domain name

`echo "Sitemap: http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml.gz" >> public/robots.txt`

TODO
----

- Add spec for sitemap rake task
